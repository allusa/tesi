\begin{frame}{Conclusions}

  \begin{itemize}

  \item We have shown a \acro{MTSMS} model, including the requirements
    for these special systems and how they can be applied to an
    example time series.

  \item \acro{MTSMS} store time series compactly and manage
    consistently its temporal dimension.

  \item A time series is split into time subseries, which we call
    resolution discs. Each has a different resolution, is compacted
    with an attribute aggregate function, and has a finite capacity.


  \item Future work: define operations. Queries to a multiresolution
    database as we would query a time series in a TSMS database.
