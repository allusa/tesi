\section{Conclusion} 
\label{sec:concl-future-work}

In this paper we have shown a MTSMS model, including the requirements
for these special systems and how they can be applied to an example
time series. The main objective is to store compactly a time series
and manage consistently its temporal dimension.

Our MTSMS model proposes to store a time series split into time
subseries, which we call resolution discs.  Each resolution disc has a
different resolution and is compacted with an attribute aggregate
function. Therefore, in a multiresolution database the configuration
parameters are the quantity of resolution discs and each of their three
parameters: the consolidation step, the attribute
aggregate function and the capacity.

The data model shown is the first step to develop a complete model for
a MTSMS but in future the operations will be defined. In this context,
there is a need for a model collecting generic properties for the
TSMS, as it can be the time series union operation or the time
interval operations. Then, the multiresolution model would be build
upon the generic TSMS model.

% In an example we have shown a possible application of a MTSMS. The
% resulting database has the information we have extracted with the
% attribute aggregate function. We show that in this example we want
% not an approximation to the original function but an extraction of
% some interesting information. Then the database is ready to answer
% time series questions keeping in mind that it holds this information
% summary.

% It may not only be interesting to keep more resolution at more recent
% times. Multiresolution could be selectable, that is high resolution is
% kept for periods of time considered interesting. For this purpose, the
% model of multiresolution needs to be changed accordingly. Furthermore,
% an interesting feature for MTSMS is to be able to configure resolution
% discs on top of the others, that is setting the one's disc as the
% buffer for another. The multiresolution model presented shows the
% simple case where each resolution disc is independent from the others.

% Time series have meta information associated \cite{dreyer94}: last
% value measured, value units, classification tags, location, etc. RDBMS
% are quite good at managing this kind of information. Therefore it
% would be great if RDBMS and TSMS could interrelate.

% Sensor networks is a promising field for TSMS. Sensor networks focus
% on monitoring great amount of sensors with limited resources which
% must be used efficiently \cite{yaogehrke02}. One approach is to store
% data distributed in sensors and resolve each query accordingly
% \cite{bonnet01}. From this point of view, it is useful to treat time
% series as data streams, which means continuously arriving data in time
% order, and operate with them incrementally as data arrives.  With
% reference to MTSMS, most recent data could be stored distributed in
% sensors and least resolution summarised data stored in central
% nodes. Then queries should be resolved distributed: if adequate
% resolution is available then it is calculated, else query is sent to
% sensor.  With reference to data streams in MTSMS, it seems that
% buffers should be reviewed to incorporate streaming capabilities and
% aggregate functions should be restricted only to those being able
% to calculate incrementally.


Concluding, in this paper we show that using TSMS facilitates
substantially time series management. The current field interest makes
us optimistic to expect soon an adequate management in
DBMS.
