\begin{frame}{Introduction}

  When observations are collected at specific time intervals, large
  data sets in the form of time series are generated. Recent emergence
  and new applications in sensor systems field \parencite{bonnet01}.

  \begin{itemize}

  \item Time series stored and managed by database management systems
    (\acro{DBMS}). The referent are relational DBMS, but for time
    series suffer some
    drawbacks \parencite{dreyer94,schmidt95,stonebraker09:scidb,zhang11}.

  \item Bitemporal \acro{DBMS} also model time concepts, but not
    interchangeable with time
    series \parencite{schmidt95,date02:_tempor_data_relat_model}.

  \item Specific \acro{DBMS} for time series: Time Series Data Base
    Management Systems \parencite{dreyer94}. Problems with voluminous
    data and time irregularities.

  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Objective:} New data model for multiresolution \acro{TSMS}.
  Time series stored with bounded capacity using different time resolutions
  and aggregations.
