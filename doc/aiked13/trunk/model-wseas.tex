\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:model:preliminaries}

In this section we introduce some background concepts and the
nomenclature which we will use later.  First we define the main
objects of a \acro{MTSMS} which are measures and time series.

A \emph{measure} is a value measured in a time instant. More formally
it is a tuple $(v,t)$ where $v$ is the value of the measure and $t \in
\mathbb{R}$ is the time instant of measurement.  The values of a time
series can be of any type. For simplicity examples are presented with
integers or real numbers but can also be strings or vectors.  Let $m =
(v,t)$ be a measure, $v$ is written as $V(m)$ and $t$ is written as
$T(m)$.

The time value defines the canonical order between measures.  Let $m =
(v_m, t_m)$ and $n = (v_n, t_n)$ be two measures, then $m\geq n$ if
and only if $t_m\geq t_n$.

A \emph{time series} is sequence of measures of the same phenomena
that are ordered in time.
\begin{definition}[Time series]
  A \emph{time series} $S$ is a a set of measures of the same
  phenomena $S = \{m_0, \ldots, m_k\}$ without repeated time values
  $\forall i,j: i\leq k, j\leq k, i\neq j : T(m_i)\neq T(m_j)$. Given
  a time series $|S|$, we note its size by $|S|=k+1$. Observe that,
  because measures in $S$ are of the same phenomena, the type of $S$
  values is homogeneous.
\end{definition}

The order defined by measures implies a total order in a time
series. As a time series is a finite set, if it is not empty it has a
maximum and a minimum.  Let $S=\{m_0,\ldots,m_k\}$ be a time series
and $n\in S$ be a measure. The time series' maximum is $n=\max(S)$ if
and only if $\forall m \in S: n \geq m $.  Similarly, the time series'
minimum is $n=\min(S)$ if and only if $\forall m \in S: n \leq m$.

Given the order defined by time, in a time series we define the
sequence interval following \cite{last:keogh,last:hetland}.  Let
$S=\{m_0, \ldots, m_k\}$ be a time series. We define the subset
$S(r,t] \subseteq S$ as the time series $S(r,t]=\{m\in S | r<T(m)\leq
t\}$, where $r$ and $t$ are two instants in time.  We also define the
subset $S(r,+\infty)\subseteq S$ as the time series $S(r,+\infty) =
\{m\in S | r< T(m) \leq T(\max(S))\}$ and the subset
$S(-\infty,t)\subseteq S$ as the time series $S(-\infty,t) = \{m\in S
| T(\min(S))\leq T(m) < t\}$.

The time order in time series also implies the sequence concept of
next and previous measure.  Let $S=\{m_0, \ldots, m_k\}$ be a time
series and $l\in S$ and $n$ be two measures. We define the next
measure of $n$ in $S$ as $l=\nex_S(n)$ where $l =
\min(S(T(n),+\infty))$. We define the previous measure of $n$ in $S$
as $l=\prev_S(n)$ where $l = \max(S(-\infty,T(n)))$.

Let $S$ be a time series, $t$ be an time instant and $\delta$ be a
time duration, then the time series' measures can be located in the
time interval $i_0=[t, t+\delta]$ and its multiples $i_j=[t+j\delta,
t+(j+1)\delta]$ for $j=0,1,2,\ldots$. When time series measures are
equally spaced we say it to be regular.
\begin{definition}[Regular time series]
  Let $S=\{m_0,$ $ldots,$ $m_k\}$ be a time series and $\delta$ a time
  duration. $S$ is regular if and only if $\forall m \in
  S(T(\min(S),+\infty):T(m) - T(\prev_S(m)) = \delta$.
\end{definition}

\section{The proposed data model}
\label{sec:MTSMS}

The \acro{MTSMS} model is an storage solution for a time series where,
in short, the information is spread in different time resolutions.
The objects of \acro{MTSMS} are measures and time series as defined in
Section~\ref{sec:model:preliminaries} and each \acro{MTSMS} database
contains only one time series.

The general schema of the \acro{MTSMS} model can be seen in the
Figure~\ref{fig:model:mtsdb}.  A multiresolution database is a
collection of resolution discs, which temporarily accumulate the
measures in a buffer where they are processed and finally stored in a
disc. The data process is mainly intended to change the time intervals
between measures in order to compact the time series information. In
this way, the time series gets stored in different time resolutions
spread in the discs.

\begin{figure}[tp]
  \centering
  \input{imatges/mtsms-arquitectura_interna.tex}
  \smallskip
  \caption{Architecture of \acro{MTSMS} model}
  \label{fig:model:mtsdb}
\end{figure}

Discs are size bounded so they only contain a fixed amount of
measures. When a disc becomes full it discards a measure. Thus,
multiresolution database is bounded in size and the time series gets
stored in pieces, that is time subseries.

Regarding to operations, \acro{MTSMS} structure needs operators to
change the time intervals between measures. Most of these operators
are attribute aggregate functions and consolidation actions.

In what follows we design the basic \acro{MTSMS} model centered in:
(i) the four basic data model elements ---buffer, disc, resolution
disc, and multiresolution database--, and (ii) the operations to
create a multiresolution database, to add measures, and to consolidate
time series. Attribute aggregate functions are required but not linked
to the model. They are defined in the
Section~\ref{sec:model:interpolador}.

A \emph{buffer} is a container for a regular or a no-regular time
series. The buffer objective is to regularise the time series with
predetermined step and attribute function. We call consolidation to
this action.
\begin{definition}[Buffer]
  A \emph{buffer} is defined as the tuple $(S,\tau,\delta,f)$ where
  $S$ is a time series, $\tau$ is the last consolidation time,
  $\delta$ is the duration of the consolidation step and $f$ is an
  attribute aggregate function.

  An empty buffer $B_{\emptyset} = (\emptyset,t_0, \delta, f)$ has an
  empty time series, an initial consolidation time $t_0$ and
  predetermined $\delta$ and $f$. From the $B_{\emptyset}$ all the
  consolidation time instants can be calculated as $t_0+i\delta,
  i\in\mathbb{N}$.
\end{definition}

Operator \emph{addBuffer} adds a measure to its time series:
$\text{addBuffer}: B = (S,\tau,\delta,f) \times m = (v,t) \mapsto
(S',\tau,\delta,f)$ where $S' = S \cup \{m\} $.

A buffer is ready to consolidate when a time of a measure is bigger
than the buffer's next consolidation time.  Let $B=(S,\tau,\delta,f)$
be a buffer and $m=\max(S)$ the maximum measure, $B$ is ready to
consolidate if and only if $T(m) \geq \tau+\delta$.  The consolidation
of $B$ in the time interval $i=[\tau,\tau+\delta]$ results in a
measure $m'=(v,\tau+\delta)$ where $m'=f(S,i)$ and $f$ is an attribute
aggregate function $f$. Operator \emph{consolidateBuffer} computes the
measure of consolidation and removes the consolidated part of the time
series from the buffer. Usually consolidateBuffer is only applied to
the present consolidation interval, $\text{consolidateBuffer}:
B=(S,\tau,\delta,f) \mapsto B' \times m' $ where $ B'=
(S',\tau+\delta,\delta,f)$, $S' = S$ and $m' =
f(S,[\tau,\tau+\delta])$. The buffer's time series can be reduced,
such as $ S' = S(\tau+\delta,\infty)$, when historic data is not
needed anymore.

A \emph{disc} is a finite capacity measures container. A time series
stored in a disc has its cardinal bounded. When the cardinal of the
time series is to overcome the limit, some measures need to be
discarded.
\begin{definition}[Disc]
  A \emph{disc} is a tuple $(S,k)$ where $S$ is a time series and
  $k\in\mathbb{N}$ is the maximum allowed cardinal of $S$.  An empty
  disc $D_{\emptyset} = (\emptyset,k)$ has an empty time series and
  the $k$ maximum cardinal allowed.
\end{definition}

The cardinal of the times series is kept under control by the add
operator, $\text{addDisc}:D=(S,k)\times m\mapsto (S',k)$ where 
$$
S' = \begin{cases}
  S\cup\{m\}                 & \text{if } |S|<k  \\
  (S-\{\min(S)\}) \cup \{m\} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}  
$$

A \emph{resolution disc} is a disc which stores a regular time
series. It is composed of a buffer, that contains the partial time
series to be regularised, and a disc, that contains the regularised
time series.
\begin{definition}[Resolution disc]
  A \emph{resolution disc} is a tuple $(B,D)$ where $B$ is a buffer
  and $D$ is a disc.  An empty buffer and empty disc imply an empty
  resolution disc $R_{\emptyset} = (B_{\emptyset},D_{\emptyset})$.
\end{definition}
 
The operators of a resolution disc are related to the buffer and disc
ones: (i) The addition of a measure to the buffer of the resolution
disc, $\text{addRD}:R=(B,D) \times m \mapsto R'$ where $R'= (B',D)$,
and $B'= \text{addBuffer}(B,m)$; (ii) The consolidation of the
resolution disc by consolidating its buffer an adding the
consolidation measure to its disc, $\text{consolidateRD}:R=(B,D)
\mapsto R'$ where $R'= (B',D')$ and $(B',m') =
\text{consolidateBuffer}(B)$ and $D'= \text{addDisc}(B,m')$.
% \]

A \emph{multiresolution database} is a set of resolution discs which
share the input of measures, that is they store the same time
series. A time series is stored regularised and distributed with
different resolutions in the various resolution discs, as it was shown
in the Figure~\ref{fig:model:mtsdb}.
\begin{definition}[Multiresolution Database]
  A \emph{Multi\-re\-solution Database} is a set of resolution discs
  $M=\{R_0, \dots, R_d\}$.  An empty multiresolution database has
  empty resolution discs $M_{\emptyset}=\{R_{0_\emptyset}, \dots,
  R_{d_\emptyset}\}$.
\end{definition}

We define the addition of a measure to every resolution disc as
$\text{addMD} : M=\{R_0, \dots, R_d\} \times m \mapsto \{R'_0, \dots,
R'_d\}$ where $R'_i=\text{addRd}(R_i,m)$.

The consolidation of all resolution discs can be defined as follows:
$\text{consolidateMD}: M=\{R_0, \dots, R_d\} \mapsto \{R'_0, \dots,
R'_d\}$ where
$$ 
R'_i = \begin{cases}
  \text{consolidateRD}(R_i) & \text{if } R_i \text{ ready to consolidate} \\
  R_i                       & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$.


\section{Attribute aggregate function}
\label{sec:model:interpolador}

An attribute aggregate function is used when a buffer is consolidated
in order to summarise information from the time series.  Let $S$ be a
time series and $t_0$ and $t_f$ two time instants, an attribute
aggregate function $f$ calculates a measure that summarises an
attribute of $S$ in the time interval $i=[T_0,T_f]$:
\begin{align*}
f&: \text{Time series} \times \text{time interval} \longrightarrow
\text{Measure} \\
f&: S=\{m_0,\ldots,m_k\} \times i=[T_0,T_f] \mapsto m'
\end{align*}

Different types of attribute aggregate functions may be used in order
to summarise a time series. For instance, we may calculate attribute
statistics from a time series such as the maximum value, the average
or apply digital signal processing operations, \cite{zhang11}.
% Furthermore, attribute aggregate functions copes with data
% validation.%, which we will discuss latter in this section.

Below there are some examples. Let $S'=S(T_0,T_f]$. Then:
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{--}
\item maximum$^d$: $S \times i \mapsto m'$ where $V(m') =
  \max_{\forall m \in S'}(V(m))$. It summarises $S'$ with the maximum
  of the measure values.
\item last$^d$: $S \times i \mapsto m'$ where $V(m') = \max(S')$. It
  summarises $S'$ with the maximum measure.
\item arithmetic mean$^d$: $S \times i \mapsto m'$ where $V(m') =
  \frac{1}{|S'|} \sum\limits_{\forall m\in S'} V(m)$. It
  summarises $S'$ with the mean of the measure values.
\end{itemize}

% With reference to data validation, attribute aggregate functions
% can cope with this process. When data has not been captured or has
% been captured erroneously, it must be treated as unknown data.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item When data has not been captured it is unknown by nature. For
%   example, we try to capture data from a sensor and there is no
%   response.
% \item When data is erroneously it must be marked as unknown. For
%   example, we capture data from a sensor but it responses in a not
%   reasonable time or we capture data that is clearly outside a
%   reasonable limits.
% \end{itemize}
% As a consequence, attribute aggregate functions deals with these two
% subprocesses: treating unknown data and marking data as
% unknown. Following with real numbers example, we extend the
% domain with a value that means 'unknown', let this unknown value be
% represented by the improper element infinity ($\infty$).

% An attribute aggregate functions treating unknown
% data is a one that can calculate a result when there are unknown
% values in the original time series, $f^u: S \times i \mapsto m'$ where
% $\exists m \in S: V(m)=\infty$. Although from a strict point of view
% operating with unknown data makes unknown result, aggregate functions
% are free to calculate whatever is needed such as time series analysis
% does with data reconstruction.

% For example, arithmetic mean$^{d}$ aggregate function returns
% $V(m')=\infty$ if $\exists m \in S: V(m)=\infty$.  We can define a new
% mean function, based on the original arithmetic mean$^{d}$ aggregate,
% that naively treats unknown values by keeping the
% known mean; in other words, it ignores unknown values found in the time
% interval: arithmetic mean$^{du}$: $S \times i \mapsto m'$ where $m' =
% \text{arithmetic mean}^{d}(S'',i)$ and $S''= \{m''\in S':V(m'')\neq
% \infty\}$.
% % ignore$^{u}$: $S \mapsto S'$ where $S'= \{m''\in S':V(m'')\neq
% % \infty\}$,
% % arithmetic mean$^{du}$: $S \times i \mapsto m'$ where $m' =
% % \text{arithmetic mean}^{d}(\text{ignore}^u(S),i)$.

% An attribute aggregate functions marking data as unknown is a one
% that can give unknown value as the resulting measure's value, $f^{mu}:
% S \times i \mapsto m'$ where $V(m')\in \mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}$.

% For example, we can define a maximum aggregate, based on the
% maximum$^d$ aggregate, that returns unknown if there is a
% measure's value bigger than 2:  maximum$^{dmu2}$: $S \times i
% \mapsto m'$ where $V(m') = 
% \begin{cases}
%   \infty &\text{if }  m''>2\\
%   m'' & \text{else }
% \end{cases}$ and $m''=\text{maximum}^d(S,i)$.

% %Per exemple definim un termini, si les dades estan més espaiades que 2 es marca com a desconeguda

To summarise, in the design of the attribute aggregate function we can
interpret a time series in different ways, that is what we call the
representation of a time series. \citeauthor{last:keogh},
\cite{last:keogh}, cite some possible representations for time series
such as Fourier transforms, wavelets, symbolic mappings or piecewise
linear representation (PLR). This last is remarked as the most used
owing to the most common representation is with linear functions,
\cite{keogh01}.

The variety of time series representations results in a variety of the
same attribute aggregate functions. For instance, a maximum attribute
aggregate function may give different values if we consider a linear
or a constant piecewise representation.

Following we show a possible family of attribute aggregate functions
for time series represented by a staircase function, that is with a
piecewise constant representation.  We define a new representation for
time series called \emph{zero-order hold backwards} (zohe) consisting
in holding each value until the preceding value, which is used
similarly by RRDtool, \cite{lisa98:oetiker}.

Let $S=\{m_0,\ldots,m_k\}$ be a time series, we define
$S(t)^{\text{zohe}}$ as its continuous representation along time $t$:
$\forall t \in \mathbb{R} ,\forall m \in S:$
\begin{equation}
 S(t)^{\text{zohe}} =  
\begin{cases}
  \infty & \text{if } t > T(\max S) \\
  V(m)   & \text{if } t\in (T(\prev_S m),T(m)]
\end{cases}
\label{eq:zohe}
\end{equation}

In conclusion, we can define many attribute aggregate functions and
thus no global assumptions can be made about them.  Therefore, the
time series representation results in attribute aggregate functions
families.  \acro{MTSMS} must allow to define user aggregate functions.
