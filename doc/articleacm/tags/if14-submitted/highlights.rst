Highlights
==========

* A multiresolution database stores time series compressed by
  aggregating the evolution of parameters along time. As a lossy
  storage solution, a multiresolution schema has to be decided for
  each application.

* Aggregation functions and representation function concept of time
  series are formalised as independent objects. Then users can define
  different operators considering the semantics of time series in
  different contexts.

* The model considers the time irregularities sampling of time
  series. Moreover, it operates coherently with the time dimension of
  time series.

* The model is firmly rooted on set and relational algebra as a formal
  theory for information systems.
