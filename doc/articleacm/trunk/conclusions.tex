SciQL defines time series as a mixture of array, set and sequence properties. We think that sequence and array are very similar in nature. 



TSDB [deri] evaluates RRDtool performance which is not so good as expected. He only evaluates compression performance but We think that a global evaluation of compression plus descompression must be done. MTSMS are not aimed to be a replacement for offline long time storage systems that are rarely queried and then queries can be slow but have tot be exact. MTSMS are adequate to stream processing and resolving queries with less data than original and so they are quicker but give information previously selected.



A Multiresolution Symbolic Representation of
Time Series; Megalooikonomou, Faloutsos; 2005 proposes multiresolution by decomposing a signal in frequency subsequences and intended mainly to similarity searching. The objective is to reconstruct the original time series. 
 

Segev87 proposed TSMS deswcribed with SQL? we have gone a bit further and proposed TSMS with typical relational algebra including set, sequence and temporal function behaviour. 






\section{Conclusions}

Tenim una consulta sobre els TSMS M=multiresolution(S) que ens permetrà estudiar que passa amb la multiresolució aplicada a una sèrie temporal, per exemple quina diferència hi ha entre fer S1+S2 i multiresolution(S1)+multiresolution(S2).
Tenim un model MTSMS que dóna pistes de com implementar la multiresolució, de l'estructura que ha de tenir.
