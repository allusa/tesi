TSMS vs temporal data: While most databases tend to model reality at a point in time (at the
“current” time), temporal databases model the states of the real world
across time.
 The transaction time for a fact is the time interval during which the fact
is current within the database system.
 In a temporal relation, each tuple has an associated time when it is true;
the time may be either valid time or transaction time.
 A bi-temporal relation stores both valid and transaction time.
