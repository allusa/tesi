Abstract
========

In this paper we define a model for multiresolution time series
database management systems. These systems store each time series
lossy compressed by extracting different resolutions and attribute
aggregations. Then time series are stored compactly, with finite
capacity and with its temporal attribute managed consistently.

For many applications it is of primary relevance that database systems
support time series.  We root our theory firmly on set and relational
algebra together with some time series analysis specific properties
that can be problematic when manipulating them.  Furthermore, we use
the time-order acquisition characteristic of time series to simplify
its treatment by stream-like computations in order to achieve fast
pre-computed queries and visualisations.
