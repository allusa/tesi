Un exemple amb dades massives.




ext we show a real example database for a time series data. Actual
data comes from a temperature distributed sensor monitoring system
\cite{alippi10}, we focus on one sensor data. We use Pytsms and
RoundRobinson implementations in order to create a \acro{MTSDB} and
to query it.

\emph{Data}. The Figure~\ref{fig:exemple:original} shows the original
data for one year and a half. The plot interpolates linearly the
measures. In this plot we can see that there is missing data and some
outlying observations. There are $146\,709$ stored values.

  \label{fig:exemple:original}
\end{figure}



\emph{Schema}. We design a \acro{MTSDB} that stores a multiresolution
time series with high resolution at recent times and with low
resolution at older times. The schema is illustrated in the
Figure~\ref{fig:exemple:window}. At the top there are four discs with
different number of measures and at the bottom there is a timeline
showing the resolution subseries along time. Going from most to least
granularity, disks are configured as follows: (i) a measure every 5 h
in the fourth disc which has a capacity of 24 measures and thus it
spans 5 days; (ii) a measure every 2 days in the third disc, with a
capacity of 20 thus spanning 40 days; (iii) a measure every 15 days in
the second disc, with a capacity of 12 thus spanning 180 days and;
(iv) a measure every 50 days in the first disc that, with a capacity
of 12 results in a span of 600 days.

% \emph{Attribute aggregate functions}.  In order to illustrate this
% example we consolidate all the resolution subseries using the
% meanzohe aggregate function and the two highest resolution
% subseries using the maximum$^\zohe{}$ aggregate function. 


% \emph{Consolidation}. The time subseries after consolidating the
% \acro{MTSDB} are shown in the Figure~\ref{fig:exemple:4mrd}, where
% each graphic corresponds to the possible $\seriedisc$ queries, that is
% every resolution disc time series from the \acro{MTSDB}. Each title
% shows the resolution subseries and its cardinal, and each attribute
% aggregate function has different colour.  Each time series is plotted
% with \zohe{} representation function $S(t)^\zohe{}$. Time axis has
% \acro{UTC} units rounded to nearest time points and temperature axis
% has Kelvin units. Outlayers are marked as discontinuities, for
% instance see fourth plot's 2938 K maximum.

  \label{fig:exemple:4mrd}
\end{figure}




% In all the four plots, we can see that mean aggregate function has
% filled missing data and filtered outlayer observations. This is due
% to the aggregate function coming from a \zohe{} interpretation.

% Figure~\ref{fig:exemple:4mrdtot} shows the $\totalseries$
% queries for the mean$^{\zohe}$ aggregate function resolution and for
% the maximum$^{\zohe}$ resolution.  Each resulting time series is
% plotted interpolating linearly its measures, note that this linearly
% visualisation seems right time displaced as time series comes from a
% \zohe{} aggregation.  Comparing this figure with the original series
% in Figure~\ref{fig:exemple:original}, we observe that it resembles an
% incremental low-pass filter because we applied mean aggregation while
% the maximum aggregation resembles an envelope function.

% In conclusion, this \acro{MTSDB} example schema does not store the
% complete original data but a compression of the original function
% which contains more information for recent times.  Each of the
% $\seriedisc$ time series is regular with $\delta$. Although
% $\totalseries$ is not a regular time series, it has piece-wise
% regularity as a concatenation of every disc's $\delta$.  The purpose
% of this example is to show how the multiresolution is computed for a
% time series, it has been computed offline as the original data had
% already been acquired. However, a \acro{MTSMS} is designed to
% consolidate while the original data is being acquired so that the
% multiresolution computation spreads along the acquisition and the
% computing time becomes less critical.
