Revision notes
==============



* Report explicitly there is not similar work
-->Not similar with respect to formalism in DBMS terms, perhaps similar implementation is RRDtool
-->Title: remove new to clarify there are not other such systems


* Abstract:
The Abstract does not present fully the paper's objectives (see relevant
comments in attached).
Prefer "formalize" in place of "define".
State that the model has been implemented on top of RoundRobinson.
"For many applications it is of primary relevance that database systems
support time series." This should be eliminated. Restrict to only the
paper objectives.



* Highlights
Aggregation functions and representation function concept of time series
are formalized as independent objects: State it better.


* Follow standards of math definitions




* Examples for some definitions which are not clear



* Expressions technically/scientifically imprecise or wrong





* Improve syntax of definitions




* Superscripts and subscripts: 1) make simpler 2) uniform use




* Terminology information/data





* English
English require major improvement. My recommendation is for the paper to
by somebody who has a good expertise in the language (see some
comments in attached).
"data": Use it in plural, e.g. "data are".





CANVIS majors
=============



* Based on relational algebra

abstract: "We root our theory firmly on set and relational algebra together with
some time series analysis specific properties that can be problematic when
manipulating them": Please state it better. Also, take into consideration
that Relational Algebra has been based on set theory.

p2c6: The model is mainly formalized in terms of relational algebra ... for database systems.
Please add that it is not based only on relational algebra.







CANVIS FETS
===========

pXcY: page X comment Y (by line order without columns notions)


p1c1: not clear expression -> 'time series come from a continuous
nature' changed to 'time series are acquired continuously from a
phenomena monitoring'


p2c2: change information for data, terminology information/data, data in plural
--> clarified information in favour of data, in future work we state that we need to evaluate information theory for the multiresolution approach.


p1c3--c4: minor changes







p23c1: eliminated notation table
