Revision notes
==============



* Report explicitly there is not similar work
-->Not similar with respect to formalism in DBMS terms, perhaps similar implementation is RRDtool
-->Title: remove new to clarify there are not other such systems


* Abstract:
The Abstract does not present fully the paper's objectives (see relevant
comments in attached).
Prefer "formalize" in place of "define".
State that the model has been implemented on top of RoundRobinson.
"For many applications it is of primary relevance that database systems
support time series." This should be eliminated. Restrict to only the
paper objectives.



* Highlights
Aggregation functions and representation function concept of time series
are formalized as independent objects: State it better.


* Follow standards of math definitions




* Examples for some definitions which are not clear



* Expressions technically/scientifically imprecise or wrong





* Improve syntax of definitions




* Superscripts and subscripts: 1) make simpler 2) uniform use




* Terminology information/data





* English
English require major improvement. My recommendation is for the paper to
by somebody who has a good expertise in the language (see some
comments in attached).
"data": Use it in plural, e.g. "data are".





CANVIS majors
=============



* Based on relational algebra

abstract: "We root our theory firmly on set and relational algebra together with
some time series analysis specific properties that can be problematic when
manipulating them": Please state it better. Also, take into consideration
that Relational Algebra has been based on set theory.

p2c6: The model is mainly formalized in terms of relational algebra ... for database systems.
Please add that it is not based only on relational algebra.

p3c6: This "generic" should appear in the abstract (Our \acro{MTSMS} model is a
generic approach to the multiresolution features, we define it open so
that users can define any attribute aggregate functions.)


p4c1: special purpose should also appear in the abstract (A \acro{TSMS} is a special purpose \acro{DBMS} devoted to store and
manage time series.)





CANVIS FETS
===========

pXcY: page X comment Y (by line order without columns notions)


intro/related work/motivation
-----------------------------

p1c1: not clear expression -> 'time series come from a continuous
 nature' changed to 'time series are acquired continuously from a
 phenomena monitoring'

p2c2: change information for data, terminology information/data, data
 in plural -> clarified information in favour of data, in future work
 we state that we need to evaluate information theory for the
 multiresolution approach.

p1c3--c4: minor changes

p2c1--c4: minor changes

p2c5: Imprecise -> 'This papers focuses on' changed to 'This paper
 provides formalism in terms of'


p3c1: minor changes

p3c2: improve sentence -> 'They notice that data needs to be shown
 over its full time range and not only subsets of data as it is
 usually provided.' changed to 'They state that other systems only
 show subsets of data, however it is also necessary to show data in
 their complete time span.'

p3c4: minor changes



p5c1: 'Our objectives have been to formalise the main concepts into an
 abstract model and to include more genericity in order to describe
 \acro{MTSMS} as fully \acro{TSMS}.' improved to 'Our objective is to
 formalise the main features into an abstract model and to incorporate
 adequate generality in order to describe mtsms as fully as a tsms.'
 as suggested.

p5c2: improve sentence.  'This regularising approach could also be
  used when the user wants to consult another resolution for a time
  series, such as changing periodic data from a month to a year step.'
  changed to 'Besides obtaining regular time series, this feature can
  also be used in order to consult other resolutions from a time
  series, such as changing a daily acquired time series to a yearly
  step summary.'


p5c3: minor changes

p5c4: confusion in times -> 'It shows a snapshot in time, suppose
 between time 9 and 10.', clarified to "It shows a snapshot in time
 spanning from time 0 to 9 and supposing that the temporal point 'now'
 is between 9 and 10."

p5c5: minor changes

p5c6: no grey appears -> grey was badly perceived, changed to
 discontinuous marks.

p5c7--9: minor changes




p6c4: minor changes

p6c6: state better -> 'but not yet the mean for time 12.' changed to
 'However the mean every three values can not be computed yet, so in
 this snapshot it keeps unknown value.'



Time series model
-----------------


p6c1: minor changes

p6c2: replaced symbol

p6c5: 



p6c9: ALERTA que afecta a totes les definicions
