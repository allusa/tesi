Revision notes
==============


* Definitions & Mathematical Expression.
We have rewritten some math definitions following math standards. We have also included more examples where required. The syntax of definitions has been simplified.



* Symbols.
We have rewritten math variables with less superscripts and subscripts. We also have uniformed the use of variables. For instance, we use 's' and 't' for pairs of times, 'm' and 'n' for pairs of measures, or 'R' and 'S' for pairs of time series. 

* Terminology.
We have clarified the use of 'information' in favour of 'data'.


* Title.
We have removed 'new' to state clearly that there are not other such systems.
We have also reported that there is not similar formalism work.

* Abstract.
We have rewritten the abstract as suggested. We have also included the content suggested.

* Highlights.
We have stated them better.


* English
The paper has had a major rewriting to improve the language.


* Other minor changes.
We have addressed the issues proposed. 
However, we would like to reply two issues: 

- Absolute value of the time expression.
We prefer to allow time duration to be negative. As a coordinate system, the distance is defined with sign.

- Should a time series rather be a list and not a set?
We define a time series as generic as possible. If we define it as set, then we
find it easily to show operations for set, sequence and temporal
function behaviour.
