  abstract =      {Time Series Data Server (TSDS) is a software package
                   for implementing a server that provides fast
                   super-setting, sub-setting, filtering, and uniform
                   gridding of time series-like data. TSDS was developed
                   to respond quickly to requests for long time spans of
                   data. Data may be served from a fast database,
                   typically created by aggregating granules (e.g., data
                   files) from a remote data source and storing them in
                   a local cache that is optimized for serving time
                   series. The system was designed specifically for time
                   series data, and is optimized for requests where the
                   longest dimension of the requested data structure is
                   time. Scalar, vector, and spectrogram time series
                   types are supported. The user can interact with the
                   server by requesting a time series, a date range, and
                   an optional filter to apply to the data. Available
                   filters include strides, block
                   average/minimum/maximum, exclude, and inequality.
                   Constraint expressions are supported, which allow
                   such operations as a request for data from one time
                   series when a different time series satisfied a
                   specified relationship. TSDS builds upon DAP (Data
                   Access Protocol), NcML (netCDF Mark-up language) and
                   related software libraries. In this work, we describe
                   the current design of this server, as well as planned
                   features and potential implementation strategies.},
