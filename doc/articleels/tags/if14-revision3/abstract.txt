Abstract
========

We formalise a specialized database management system model for
time series using a multiresolution approach. These special
purpose database systems store time series lossy compressed in a
space-bounded storage. Time series can be stored at multiple
resolutions, using distinct attribute aggregations and keeping its
temporal attribute managed in a consistent way.

The model exhibits a generic approach that facilitates its
customization to suit better the actual application requirements
in a given context. The elements the meaning of which
depends on a real application are of generic nature.
   
Furthermore, we consider some specific time series properties that
are a challenge in the multiresolution approach. We also describe
a reference implementation of the model and introduce a use case
based on real data.
