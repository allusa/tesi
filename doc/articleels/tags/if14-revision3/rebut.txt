Revision notes
==============

Reviewer notes:

* General comments:
  We have applied the comments found in the attached PDF.

* We have rewritten the supremum definition, as it induced confusion
  whether we were applying sup(empty)= -infty to a real or we were
  applying sup(empty) = (-infty,infty) to a time series.  We have also
  clarified that the supremum of a time series returns a measure.

* We have exemplified the sum of two time series to be able to cite it later. 

* Technical problems:
  We have rewritten the definition for temporal
  representation functions.  We have added another use case for
  temporal selection operation and we have also added the Example 4.
  Now Section 4.2.3 clearly states that temporal function operations
  compute new time instants, even if they are not contained in the
  original time series.  Then considering the proposed e = 0 and d =
  5, we obtain the measures at time instants 5, 10, 15, 20,
  25... independently whether they are contained in the original time
  series. Note that In Example 4 we consider a simpler case to
  exemplify together temporal selection, temporal join, and binary sum
  with dissimilar time sets.



Editor notes:

* English: The paper has had a careful review to improve the language.
  We have sought advice which has lead to many changes in grammatical
  and expression issues.
 
* Soundness of operators:
  We have stated better when we prefer to give
  genericity to operators. On the one hand, it allows the users to
  extend easily the functionality of operators. On the other hand, the
  users are responsible for the definitions of these extensions. For
  instance, this happens for the map operator, where we prefer not to
  restrict the f function that the users might define. However we note
  some safe cases, e.g. operating only with values.

* Manipulation of time series: We have clarified the purpose of the
  new operations we are formalising. We have added the Example 4,
  which shows how to regularise time series with a TSMS. Then we show
  how multiresolution in a MTSMS can lighten the cumbersome of
  temporal selection or temporal join, owing to the fact that time
  series are stored regularised.

* We have added Example 6 to show that the formalised model is capable
  of updating online the processed data when adding a new measure.

* We have noted as a future work the need for a direct comparison with
  other relational query languages and temporal query languages.
  Indeed, we are working with this kind of implementations. However
  they lead to diverse use cases and implementation requirements of
  each language to compare in detail every operation that we
  formalise.
