Highlights
==========

* A multiresolution database stores time series compressed by
  aggregating the evolution of parameters along time. As a lossy
  storage solution, a multiresolution schema has to be decided for
  each application.

* The model exhibits a generic approach. This allows the user to
  customise it according to the actual requirements of a given
  context. Aggregation functions and representation function concept
  of time series are customisable depending on the actual application
  semantic meaning.

* The model considers the time irregularities sampling of time
  series. Moreover, it operates coherently with the time dimension of
  time series.

* The formalism is based on set theory and is heavily
  inspired by relational database theory.
