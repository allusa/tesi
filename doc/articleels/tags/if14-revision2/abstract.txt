Abstract
========

We formalise a model for multiresolution time series database
management systems.  These special purpose database systems store time
series lossy compressed in a space-bounded storage.  Time series can
be stored at multiple resolutions, using distinct attribute
aggregations, while keeping its temporal attribute consistently
managed.
   
The model exhibits a generic approach. This allows the user to
customise it according to the actual requirements of a given context.
All the model pieces that hold a semantic meaning depend on the actual
application.

Furthermore, we consider some specific time series properties that are
a challenge in the multiresolution approach.  We also describe a
reference implementation of the model and introduce an use case based
on real data.
