Abstract
========

In this paper we introduce a model for
multiresolution time series database management systems.  These
special purpose database systems store time series lossy compressed in
a space-bounded storage.  Time series can be stored at multiple
resolutions, using distinct attribute aggregations, while keeping
its temporal attribute consistently managed.
   
The model exhibits a generic approach. This allows the user to
customise it according to the actual requirements of a given context.
All the model pieces that hold a semantic meaning depend on the actual
application.


In this paper we offer a formalisation of the model built upon set
theory and heavily inspired on relational database theory.
Furthermore, we consider some specific time series properties that are
a challenge in the multiresolution approach.  The paper also describes
a reference implementation of the model and introduces a use case
based on real data.
