Revision notes
==============

* Title:
We have changed the title as suggested to highlight the
formalism part of the paper.

* Abstract:
We have improved it as suggested.
We use formalise instead of introduce. We have also applied it to the rest of the paper.

* Highlights
We have applied the minor changes proposed.


* Definition for "distance":
We stick to the math definition and in accordance with it we define the duration between two times as d = |s - t|.


* Use of keywords in text
We have written keywords in italics when they are defined or used for first time.

* Reduced version of the paper in WSEAS
We have cited the paper and summarised its ideas, which were our initial motivation for formalising a complete model for multiresolution systems.


* General comments:

We have rewritten the internal references with the suggested style.

We have corrected the mistaken names for sets. We have also corrected
them in figures.


We have clarified the confusing notation for time series S(t) S(s,t)
and for measures (t,v). We have changed the interval notation to
[s:t], (s:t), [s:t) and (s:t]. In consequence, the interval operations
applied to time series become S[s:t], S(s:t), etc. which avoids
conflicts with other notation.


We have provided recalls and references to some concepts as they were used far from definitions.
