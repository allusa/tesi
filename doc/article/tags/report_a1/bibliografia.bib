volume={41},

pages={540 -551}, 
abstract={In this paper, a model-based fault prognosis method is developed for hybrid systems with multiple incipient faults. The concept of augmented global analytical redundancy relations is proposed for the identification of degradation of components, such as sensors and actuators, which cannot be described by physical parameters. In addition, multiple incipient faults are considered in a complex hybrid system, and these faults can develop during a mode when the faults are not detectable. The unknown degradation characteristic of each incipient fault is identified with the closest matching one of some prescribed dynamic models. The resultant degradation model will serve as a base for prognosis. In the process of fault detection and isolation, the degradation models and faults are identified using a multiple-adaptive-hybrid-particle-swarm-optimization algorithm. The proposed methodology and algorithm are verified with simulation as well as experiments.},

   abstract = {Time Series Data Server (TSDS) is a software package for implementing a server that provides fast super-setting, sub-setting, filtering, and uniform gridding of time series-like data. TSDS was developed to respond quickly to requests for long time spans of data. Data may be served from a fast database, typically created by aggregating granules (e.g., data files) from a remote data source and storing them in a local cache that is optimized for serving time series. The system was designed specifically for time series data, and is optimized for requests where the longest dimension of the requested data structure is time. Scalar, vector, and spectrogram time series types are supported. The user can interact with the server by requesting a time series, a date range, and an optional filter to apply to the data. Available filters include strides, block average/minimum/maximum, exclude, and inequality. Constraint expressions are supported, which allow such operations as a request for data from one time series when a different time series satisfied a specified relationship. TSDS builds upon DAP (Data Access Protocol), NcML (netCDF Mark-up language) and related software libraries. In this work, we describe the current design of this server, as well as planned features and potential implementation strategies.},

   abstract = {Sensor nodes are small devices that “measure” their environment and communicate feeds of low-level data values to a base station for further processing and archiving. Dissemination of these multi-valued feeds is challenging because of the limited resources (processing, bandwidth, energy) available in the nodes of the network. In this paper, we first describe the SBR algorithm for compressing multi-valued feeds containing historical data from each sensor. The key to our technique is the base signal , a series of values extracted from the real measurements that is used to provide piece-wise approximation of the measurements. While our basic technique exploits correlations among measurements taken on a single node, we further show how it can be adapted to exploit correlations among multiple nodes in a localized setting. Sensor nodes may form clusters and, within a cluster, a group leader identifies and coalesces similar measurements taken by different nodes. This localized mode of operation further improves the accuracy of the approximation, typically by a factor from 5 to 15. We provide detailed experiments of our algorithms and make direct comparisons against standard approximation techniques like Wavelets, Histograms and the Discrete Cosine Transform, on a variety of error metrics and for real data sets from different domains.},

Related fundamental problems such as dimensionality reduction, transformation, pattern mining, and similarity search have been studied extensively. Although the time series data are dynamic by nature, as in data streams, current solutions to these fundamental problems have been mostly for the static time series databases. In this paper, we first propose a framework to online summary generation for large-scale and dynamic time series data, such as data streams. Then, we propose online transform-based summarization techniques over data streams that can be updated in constant time and space. We present both the exact and approximate versions of the proposed techniques and provide error bounds for the approximate case. One of our main contributions in this paper is the extensive performance analysis. Our experiments carefully evaluate the quality of the online summaries for point, range, and k – nn queries using real-life dynamic data sets of substantial size.},

   abstract = {Advanced applications in fields such as CAD, software engineering, real-time process control, corporate repositories and digital libraries require the construction, efficient access and management of large, shared knowledge bases. Such knowledge bases cannot be built using existing tools such as expert system shells, because these do not scale up, nor can they be built in terms of existing database technology, because such technology does not support the rich representational structure and inference mechanisms required for knowledge-based systems. This paper proposes a generic architecture for a knowledge base management system intended for such applications. The architecture assumes an object-oriented knowledge representation language with an assertional sublanguage used to express constraints and rules. It also provides for general-purpose deductive inference and special-purpose temporal reasoning. Results reported in the paper address several knowledge base management issues. For storage management, a new method is proposed for generating a logical schema for a given knowledge base. Query processing algorithms are offered for semantic and physical query optimization, along with an enhanced cost model for query cost estimation. On concurrency control, the paper describes a novel concurrency control policy which takes advantage of knowledge base structure and is shown to outperform two-phase locking for highly structured knowledge bases and update-intensive transactions. Finally, algorithms for compilation and efficient processing of constraints and rules during knowledge base operations are described. The paper describes original results, including novel data structures and algorithms, as well as preliminary performance evaluation data. Based on these results, we conclude that knowledge base management systems which can accommodate large knowledge bases are feasible.},

abstract={Embedded control systems are often implemented in small microprocessors enabled with real-time technology. In this context, control laws are often designed according to discrete-time control systems theory and implemented as hard real-time periodic tasks. Standard discrete-time control theory mandates to periodically sample (input) and actuate (output). Depending on how input/output (I/O) operations are performed within the hard real-time periodic task, different control task models can be distinguished. However, existing task models present important drawbacks. They generate task executions prone to violate the periodic control demands, a problem known as sampling and latency jitter, or they impose synchronized I/O operations at each task job execution that produce a constant but artificially long I/O latency. In this paper, the one-shot task model for implementing control systems in embedded multitasking hard real-time platforms is presented. The novel control task model is built upon control theoretical results that indicate that standard control laws can be implemented considering only periodic actuation. Taking advantage of this property, the one-shot task model is shown to remove endemic problems for real-time control systems such as sampling and latency jitters. In addition, it can minimize the harmful effects that long I/O latencies have on control performance. Extensive simulations and real experiments show the feasibility and effectiveness of the novel task model, compared to previous real-time and/or control-based solutions.},
