  Current monitoring systems are an essential part of supervising
  control as they manage a large amount of information. Data
  collection is normally studied as a time series owing to it fits
  into sequence of values.  Thanks to the facility of designing
  monitoring hardware, the measurement of data has increased the last
  decade and there is not enough capacity to store nor process all the
  time series. Therefore, we need to design database management
  systems capable of storing and processing efficiently the time
  series. Moreover, this systems have to cope with the measurements
  not happening at regular time intervals as it is a restriction
  imposed by some time series treatment algorithms.

  In this paper a formal model for a time series database management
  system is designed.  It is called Multiresoltion Time Series
  Database Management Systems model (MTSMS). A Time series is
  compactly stored in the database and the information is summarised
  by different interpolation functions. From this model this kind of
  DBMS will be better understood, new implementations will be possible
  and we will be able to enhance its potential.

\section{Introduction}

This paper focuses on Data Base Management Systems (DBMS) that store
and treat data as time series.  Traditional DBMS, as is ones derived
from relational model, are not adequate for these cases as they do not
have enough facilities to manage and retrieve time series
information \parencite{schmidt95}.

Some DBMS have already taken into account the specificities of time
series, then called Time Series Data Base Management Systems
(TSMS) \parencite{dreyer94}.  Time Series Data
Server \parencite{weigel10} allows to select a data range from a time
series and to apply a filter when the data is retrieved.
RRDtool \parencite{rrdtool} applies filters and stores different data
ranges when data is stored, moreover it considers that the sampling
times can not be equally spaced, the temporal order is essential and
the value and time must be stored together. However, this TSMS lack
the complete definition of the relation between the three main fields
involved: time series, monitoring systems and DBMS.

Monitoring sensor data and processing this data to achieve diagnosis,
prognosis, prediction, data fusion or other time series analysis tasks are common in many fields such as prognosis in degradation models \parencite{yu11}, qualify sensor health in navy vessels \parencite{palmer07}, validate and reconstruct data in water distribution networks \parencite{quevedo10}, sensor networks information dissemination \parencite{deligiannakis07} or economic stock classification \parencite{dreyer95}. Time series data mining formalises the knowledge discovery in time series databases \parencite{last01}. 


DBMS are based from formal models that define the objects and
operations of the abstract machine to which users interact, such is
the relational model \parencite{date}. TSMS lack a consolidated formal
model, although special properties and requirements for a TSMS
have been proposed \parencite{dreyer94}.

In this paper
a model is proposed for an storage system that will keep a time series
in a multiresolution and bounded way.  In this first proposal there
are six definitions that are related to the data storage mechanism:
measure, time series, buffer, disc, resolution disc, and multiresolution
database. Some of this concepts are familiar with RRDtool
operating mode.

The paper is organised as follows. In \autoref{sec:preliminaries} the preliminaries concerning TSMS are summarised. In \autoref{sec:TSMS} the state of TSMS is shown as well as known similar systems that are designed with some TSMS properties. In \autoref{sec:MTSMS} a model for a multiresolution TSMS is presented for the first time. Possible reference implementations of this model are explored in \autoref{sec:implementation}. In sections \ref{sec:conclusion} and \ref{sec:future}  the MTSMS is concluded and future work is proposed. In \autoref{sec:notation} the main nomenclature and notation used in the paper is summarised.
